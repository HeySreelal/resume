# Personal Resume

This repository contains my resume coded in LaTeX. LaTeX is a typesetting system commonly used for technical and scientific documents, making it an excellent choice for creating a professional resume.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HeySreelal/resume.git
```

## Prerequisites

You'll need a LaTeX distribution installed on your system to compile the `.tex` file into a PDF. You can download and install LaTeX from [LaTeX Project](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).

## Compilation

To compile the LaTeX document into a PDF, navigate to the repository directory and run:

```bash
pdflatex Resume.tex
```

This will generate a PDF file named `Resume.pdf` in the same directory.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the resume template to fit your needs. You can modify the content, formatting, and layout by editing the `Resume.tex` file using any text editor.
